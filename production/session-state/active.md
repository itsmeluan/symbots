# Active Session State

## Current Task
Session 14: **Move Database GDD authoring** (/design-system move-database, lean mode). Skeleton created at design/gdd/move-database.md; beginning Section A (Overview).
**Key decision locked (this session):** Move DB will ADD a per-move power coefficient (renegotiating MOVE-CONTRACT-1's "stat-scaled only" constraint) so Light/Heavy/Signature moves differ in damage. Mechanism recommendation to settle at Formulas: POST-DF-1 multiply (mirrors ratified TBC-F5 Stagger; leaves DF-1 [1,225] + epsilon scans untouched) vs. inside-DF-1 (invalidates DF-1 range, needs TBC errata + re-scan). Central jobs: ratify/renegotiate MOVE-CONTRACT-1 (OQ-TBC-1), decide SCAN payload (OQ-TBC-3), UTILITY taxonomy (OQ-TBC-4).

## Prior Task (Session 13 — CLOSED)
Turn-Based Combat GDD: **APPROVED 2026-07-10** (fix-confirmation re-review, lean would-be — ran full fix-confirmation: systems-designer, qa-lead, game-designer, creative-director). All 7 round-1 blockers confirmed resolved; 0 new blockers. 3 non-gating follow-ups tracked in review log (AC-TBC-37 dual-path fixture; hit_resolved target→region-intent for Part-Break; ON_OVERHEAT dispatch watch). systems-index + review-log + GDD header updated.

## Prior Completed
- Enemy Database GDD: APPROVED 2026-07-10 (Session 4)
- Part Database GDD: APPROVED (+ visual amendment 2026-07-10)
- Damage Formula GDD: APPROVED
- Symbot Assembly System GDD: APPROVED 2026-07-10 (Session 5)
- Synergy System GDD: APPROVED 2026-07-10 (Session 12, re-review #6; GDD design phase CLOSED — no re-review #7 per CD)

## TBC Review Round 1 — Outcome of Record (2026-07-10)
- Specialists raised 11 BLOCKING; CD confirmed **7 genuine** (only 1 true contradiction — the Shock sign convention; rest were load-bearing spec silences). Zero mechanic redesigns.
- CD performed the skipped CD-GDD-ALIGN gate manually: **Player Fantasy passes on substance**; pillar-tracing (2, 4) clean.
- CD tension rulings: (1) SCAN = RECOMMENDED for TBC (runtime stub added; effect decision escalated to Move DB); (2) free forced switch = balance-watch OQ-TBC-7, not a rule change ("the degenerate play is usually the correct play"); (3) repair stall — mechanic fine, but the anti-stall proof needed the Energy-brake contract.
- Scope signal: XL (12 dependencies, cross-cutting orchestrator, errata on 4 Approved docs).

## Revisions Applied (blocker → fix, all in design/gdd/turn-based-combat.md)
1. `snapshotted_processing` → **ratified PRE-synergy** (`final_stat["processing"]`, never SYN-F4) — user decision; keeps 0–110 ranges exact, epsilon scans valid; AC-TBC-29 "effective processing" wording fixed
2. Shock sign contradiction → renamed to `shock_magnitude` everywhere (replace_all); TBC-F4 outputs/stores POSITIVE 0–33, TBC-F1 subtracts; both variable tables now agree
3. REPAIR Energy-brake → contract rule in Rule 9: `energy_cost > BASE_ENERGY_REGEN` (≥11); TBC-F6 anti-stall rewritten; new AC-TBC-38 (ADVISORY, DEFERRED content validation)
4. Part-Break harvest-dilemma anchor → BINDING Pillar-2 obligation in Dependencies downstream table (Part-Break MUST make part-targeting cost something; must carry its own AC); lean-mode note in Player Fantasy marked resolved
5. `hit_resolved` + `is_battle_active()` → new "Hook Contracts" AC section: AC-TBC-34 (emits once per DAMAGE move, post-Stagger damage 60 fixture — python3-verified vs. exact rational, round gives 61, discriminating), AC-TBC-35 (lockout predicate)
6. Status lifecycle → AC-TBC-36 (decrement-and-expire; status ABSENT at duration 0; no 3rd tick)
7. Voluntary switch → AC-TBC-37 (consumes the turn; contrast with forced AC-TBC-12)

Recommended also applied: AC-TBC-06 split (state vs. rendering — UI assertions moved to Combat UI's ledger); AC-TBC-17 hardened (turn-start bookkeeping before FLED + WILD action-set FAIL); AC-TBC-40 (ON_TURN_START/ON_BATTLE_START dispatch w/ synthetic registry entries); SCAN stub (Rule 9 + EC-TBC-16 + AC-TBC-39: turn-consuming no-op, costs paid); Stagger-doesn't-reduce-Burn note (TBC-F3); TBC-F6 heat/Rule-5 ref; BASE_ENERGY_REGEN hard-floor-8 note; energy_power 110+40 ceiling derivation; heat_max removed from Assembly snapshot row (constant 100, Part DB owns); AC-TBC-22 T=1.0-neutral note; AC-TBC-24 direct-apply_status clarification; OQ-TBC-7 added.
- AC count corrected: **40 numbered (37 BLOCKING unit, 3 ADVISORY) + 4 DEFERRED INT** (prior "29 BLOCKING" was an undercount). ECs now 16 (EC-TBC-16 = SCAN stub).
- No formula coefficients changed — existing epsilon scans remain valid; new AC-TBC-34 fixture value (77×0.79 → floor 60) python3-verified in-session.

## Next Steps
1. **Re-review**: /design-review design/gdd/turn-based-combat.md in a FRESH session (fix-confirmation focus on the 7 blocker regions per CD's mature-doc retuning directive) — OR user may accept-as-approved
2. After TBC approval: consider /design-system move-database BEFORE Encounter Zone (#7) — TBC's MOVE-CONTRACT-1 needs ratification (OQ-TBC-1), SCAN payload needs definition (OQ-TBC-3), Part DB AC-13 blocked on it
3. Pending errata on Approved docs (TBC Dependencies section): Enemy DB ED1-simplified + EDB-2 synergy-ceiling addendum; Synergy OQ-2 budget-closure; DF-1 registry range [1,225]; Part DB ammo_cost=0 content rule

## Standing Obligations (carried forward)
- Part-Break GDD: **BINDING Pillar-2 obligation** (part-targeting must cost something) + own AC — recorded in TBC Dependencies
- Move DB GDD: ratify MOVE-CONTRACT-1 incl. SCAN stub + REPAIR energy_cost ≥ 11
- Part Database content plan + Drop System GDD: Beat 2 vs. OQ-7 5–6 parts-per-tag minimum (HARD CONSTRAINT)
- Economy Designer: Synergy OQ-2's three calibration mandates before MVP content ships
- Workshop UI GDD: DCO-1…9 + combined-tier dual-track + ux-designer #6 findings
- Workshop System GDD: DCO-8 battle-time equip lockout (TBC side now testable via AC-TBC-35)
- Playtest: OQ-TBC-7 free-forced-switch balance watch

## CD PROCESS DIRECTIVES (binding, carried from Session 12)
- Retune adversarial review prompts for mature documents (~3+ cycles): "test could be stronger" is not BLOCKING when the spec is unambiguous. TBC is at cycle 1 — full adversarial was appropriate; re-review should be fix-confirmation focused.

## Move DB Sections Written (design/gdd/move-database.md)
- Overview ✓ (Part DB read-only sibling; ratifies MOVE-CONTRACT-1 + power_tier addition)
- Player Fantasy ✓ (borrowed/enabling — "the move panel is the build speaking")
- Detailed Design ✓ — Rules 1-9: schema (MOVE-CONTRACT-1 + power_tier), behavior classes, power-tier coherence table {LIGHT .80/STANDARD 1.00/HEAVY 1.20/SIGNATURE 1.40, Basic 0.70}, Basic Attack template, status moves, SCAN=reveal break_regions (ED6), REPAIR (energy_cost>10), UTILITY=Vent (dump Heat), upgrade_effects semantics (SKILL_UNLOCK/SKILL_ENHANCE)
- Formulas ✓ — MOVE-F1 `max(1,floor(df1_output×power_mult+0.0001))`, output [1,315]. **Epsilon LOAD-BEARING** (python3-verified in-session: 10 cases, e.g. 165×1.40=230.9999→231; SD wrongly called it defensive — memory updated). Pipeline DF-1→MOVE-F1→TBC-F5. Balance: SIGNATURE+max-synergy = 3-turn boss kill (vs TBC's 4), ruled acceptable (Heat-gated).
- Edge Cases ✓ — EC-MDB-01..10 (each cites an AC)
- Dependencies ✓ — resolves TBC OQ-1/3/4; errata table
- Tuning Knobs ✓ — power_mult tiers + vent_amount
- Visual/Audio + UI ✓ — brief delegation notes
- Acceptance Criteria ✓ — 22 ACs (18 BLOCKING unit + 1 BLOCKING-DEFERRED + 3 ADVISORY-DEFERRED content-val). qa-lead structural fixes accepted; its load-bearing-epsilon arithmetic ERROR rejected per python3 scan (2nd specialist to mis-analyze this epsilon).
- Open Questions ✓ — OQ-MDB-1..6
- **GDD COMPLETE** — status "Designed — pending /design-review" (lean mode; CD-GDD-ALIGN skipped per lean).

## Move DB Design Decisions (locked this session)
- power_tier ENUM (not free float), coherent w/ Part DB energy/heat tiers
- power_mult applied POST-DF-1 (mirrors TBC-F5 Stagger) → DF-1 [1,225] stays untouched
- SCAN reveals enemy break_regions + drop hints → delivers Enemy DB ED6
- UTILITY = exactly 1 move (Vent) in MVP

## Phase 5 DONE this session
- Registry: added MOVE-F1 (formula, [1,315], LOAD-BEARING epsilon), POWER_TIER_MULTIPLIERS (constant); TBC-F5 range [1,225]→[1,315] + move-db referenced_by; DF-1 referenced_by +move-db (range unchanged).
- **TBC errata APPLIED this session** (OQ-MDB-3 discharged, not deferred): TBC-F5 var table + output range→[1,315]; Rule 10 pipeline note (DF-1→MOVE-F1→TBC-F5); AC preamble range note; OQ-TBC-1/3/4 marked RESOLVED; AC-TBC-39 SCAN-reveal erratum; AC-TBC-34 post-power note; TBC status header errata line. TBC remains APPROVED (errata, not re-review).
- systems-index: Move DB Not Started→Designed; tracker started 6→7, MVP designed 6/22→7/22.
- Memory updated: project-float-epsilon-empirics += MOVE-F1 load-bearing.

## Next Steps
1. /design-review design/gdd/move-database.md in a FRESH session (never same-session as authoring)
2. /consistency-check to confirm the TBC-F5/[1,315] errata is coherent registry-wide
3. Next MVP system in design order: #1b Passive Database (unblocks OQ-MDB-1 rider passives + TBC Rule 13 registry) OR #7 Encounter Zone
